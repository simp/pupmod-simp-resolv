## Description

This module sets up DNS client config, including `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/host.conf`.


### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://simp-project.com),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they may be submitted to our [bug tracker](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:

 * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.


## Setup


### What resolv affects

  * `/etc/resolv.conf`
  * `/etc/host.conf`
  * `Network Manager`


### Beginning with resolv

Include the class on any systems you want to manage.


## Usage

Include the class from hiera:

```yaml
---
classes:
  - ::resolv
```

File contents can be tweaked by adding more hieradata:

```yaml
---
resolv::rotate: false
resolv::host_conf::multi: true
```

## nmcli

Managing device DNS entries can be done via nmcli accordingly:

```yaml
---
resolv::use_nmcli: true
resolv::nmcli_device_name: 'eth0'
resolv::nmcli_ignore_auto_dns: true
resolv::nmcli_auto_reapply_device: true
```

## Reference

Please refer to the [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md).

## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the [`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.


## Development

Please read our [Contribution Guide] (https://simp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).
