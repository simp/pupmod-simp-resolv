* Tue Dec 12 2017 Chris Tessmer <chris.tessmer@onyxpoint.com> - 0.1.0-0
- Improve validation for resolv.conf parameters
- Add type aliases, epp with typed parameters
- Update data types in init.pp parameter list (backwards compatible)
  - NOTE: The data type for the parameters `$resolv::servers` and
    `$resolv::search` has changed from `Simplib::Netlist` to Arrays with more
    specific requirements.  This has not been considered a breaking API change,
    since the original data types were too permissive and non-valid data would
    have either been ignored or broken name resolution.
